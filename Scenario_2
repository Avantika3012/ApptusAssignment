Q2 - SCENARIO
Macro Life, a healthcare company has recently setup the entire Network and Infrastructure on Azure. 
The infrastructure has different components such as Virtual N/W, Subnets, NIC, IPs, NSG etc.
The IT team currently has developed PowerShell scripts to deploy each component where all the properties of each resource is set using PowerShell commands.
The business has realized that the PowerShell scripts are growing over period of time and difficult to handover when new admin onboards in the IT.
The IT team has now decided to move to ARM based deployment of all resources to Azure.
All the passwords are stored in a Azure Service known as key Vault. The deployments needs to be automated using Azure DevOps using IaC(Infrastructure as Code).

1) What are different artifacts you need to create - name of the artifacts and its purpose
Solution: 3 different types of artifacts we need to create:
Build artifacts: These are used to test or deploy the app
pipeline artifacts: These are used to store build output and also move files between jobs in pipeline

2) List the tools you will to create and store the ARM templates.
Solution: 
the following tools can be used to store ARM templates:
Azure Repos
Git 
Azure Storage account
3) Explain the process and steps to create automated deployment pipeline. 
 Solution:
To create automated deployment pipeline, PFB steps required to achieve it.
Create organization in Azure DevOps
Create Project
Go to pipelines. Choose to create a new pipeline
Select the repository where the code reside like Azure Repos. 
Create a starter pipeline
Add ARM deployment task to deploy a resource group. Use the task name as AzureResourceGroupDeployment@2

4) Create a sample ARM template you will use to deploy a Windows VM of any size
Solution:

{




 "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",


 "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",


 "parameters": {


   "adminUsername": {


     "type": "string",


     "metadata": {


       "description": "User name for the Virtual Machine."


     }


   },


   "adminPassword": {


     "type": "securestring",


     "metadata": {


       "description": "Password for the Virtual Machine."


     }


   },

{




 "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",


 "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",


 "parameters": {


   "adminUsername": {


     "type": "string",


     "metadata": {


       "description": "User name for the Virtual Machine."


     }


   },


   "adminPassword": {


     "type": "securestring",


     "metadata": {


       "description": "Password for the Virtual Machine."


     }


   },


         "adminPassword": "[parameters('adminPassword')]"


       },


       "storageProfile": {


         "imageReference": {


           "publisher": "[variables('imagePublisher')]",


           "offer": "[variables('imageOffer')]",


           "sku": "[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]",


           "version": "latest"


         },


         "osDisk": {


           "createOption": "FromImage"


         },


         "dataDisks": [


           {


             "diskSizeGB":“[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]”,


             "lun": 0,


             "createOption": "Empty"


           }


         ]


       },

5) Explain how will you access the password stored in Key Vault and use it as Admin Password in the VM ARM template.
Solution: We need to enable property in key vault “enabledForTemplateDeployment”. This property needs to be set to true.

{




 "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",


 "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",


 "parameters": {


   "adminUsername": {


     "value": "Avantika"


   },


   "adminPassword": {


     "reference": {


       "keyVault": {


         "id": "Keyvault_Avantika"


       },


       "secretName": "Password_for_Admin"


     }


   }


 }


}

Above code can be specified in parameters section and this parameter can be called in VM creation while setting username and password.
